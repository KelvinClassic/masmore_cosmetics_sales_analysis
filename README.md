# Mas-More Cosmetics Sales Analysis

### Problem Statement
- Data Fragmentation: Sales data is collected manually across the two branches, leading to fragmentated, error-prone records.

- Limited Data Analysis: The lack of data analysis tools hinders the company's ability to gain insights into product performance, customer preferences, and regional trends.

- Resources Allocation: MASMORE Cosmetics struggles to allocate resources efficiently, leading to stockouts or overstock situations.
